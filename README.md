Overall, your job is to build out a functional client side. Request data from the API, then render that data on the front end. The front end should allow the user to:

    - View the roster.
    - Observe a player's details.
    - Add players to the roster.
    - Etc.

All the data you need is available through the API. Your job is to leverage it.

Getting Started:

1. Review the rubric at the bottom of this page.

2. Open up the docs for the the Puppy Bowl API.Links to an external site.

   - Review the API to learn about what endpoints are provided, how to access them, and what data they return.

3. Create a GitHub repository named Unit2.PuppyBowl and connect it to your PuppyBowl Github Project. Don't forget to include the instructional team members as group members if you make the repo private.

4. Start planning. Begin by translating each rubric criterion into a corresponding ticket.
